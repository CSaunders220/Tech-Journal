# Lab #0: Environment Setup

## Overview

Lab00 got the setup work out of the way ahead of the rest of the semester (at least the basics). This covered setting up an AD on server core, setting up a management box with windows server GUI, the firewall, and the workstation box.

## Interesting Terms and Topics

1. Cross-platform Authentication

One of my many goals that I have in this class is to take a lot of what I learn and apply it in my other projects, classes, and endeavors. One of the main things is that as I learn, I want to take the useful and practical aspects and apply them to the networks that I currently manage. The network in question is very basic and barebones and has taught me a lot of topics that we have not covered in class but on the other hand, there is a lot that it is lacking. I aim to take some of these concepts from the class and apply them in order to make my job, transfer of my job eventually, and maintenance on the other networks that I manage easier.

2. Automation

This is something that I should know more about, at least in my opinion, but I really have not had much time for myself to personally explore outside of the classroom environment. This makes life so much easier when it comes down to it and so I want to eventually become an automation genius. This concept is very likely to be the key to a future in cyber or tech in general so I want to learn and understand as much as I can throughout this course in order to prep me for the other advanced classes in this topic and for eventual jobs and careers.

3. Alternative Virtualization

While Vcenter is great, from a UI/UX P.O.V. on a very surface level, I am very excited to be working more in depth with alternative virtualization platforms and solutions. I do have some experience building networks and systems in Proxmox and I am looking forward to using it for some of this class, but I am also excited that there is a potential to explore other alternatives and different platforms. The more that I am familiar with, the more versatile my skill set is and therefore I can apply my knowledge to a wider range of network environments and I am really excited for that.
